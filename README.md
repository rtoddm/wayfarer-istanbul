## Overview

Wayfarer is a responsive, static travel guide focused on thoughtful exploration and narrative-driven destination content. This project serves as an early design
and content prototype for a future travel journaling platform.

## What This Project Explores

- Mobile-first responsive layout using Bootstrap
- Equal-height card layouts with flex utilities
- SVG logo integration and branding
- Content-first design for travel storytelling

## Scope

This is intentionally a static site. No JavaScript frameworks or backend
functionality are included.

## What I’d Build Next

- Entry-based travel posts
- Location tagging and metadata
- Interactive maps and timelines
