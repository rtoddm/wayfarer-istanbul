Burgazada is the third largest of the Princes' Islands in the Sea of Marmara, near Istanbul, Turkey. It is officially a neighborhood in the municipality and district of Adalar, Istanbul Province, Turkey and the name Burgas is thought to be derived from Pyrgos.

Historically, the island was mainly inhabited by Greeks and in the 20th century many Jews from Istanbul settled here. However, with the dwindling of Turkey's minorities, the make-up of the local population is now virtually indistinguishable from the rest of Istanbul. Ferries connect the island with the mainland from terminals at Eminönü and Kabataş on the European side of Istanbul and from Kadıköy and Bostancı on the Asian side.
